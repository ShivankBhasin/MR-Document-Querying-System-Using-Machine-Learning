# MR-Document-Querying-System-Using-Machine-Learning
The MR Document Querying System is designed to streamline the process of managing Material Requisition (MR) 
documents for Engineers India Limited (EIL). The goal is to develop a machine learning-based system to effectively 
query and extract relevant information from a vast collection of MR documents, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in 
handling these crucial documents.

Project Overview
The project is designed to:

1) Extract Text from PDF: Extract text from PDF documents and parse it into a structured format.
2) Preprocess Data: Label encode the data and split it into training and validation sets.
3) Model Training: Use a transformer-based model (BERT) to classify text into predefined categories.
4) Prediction: Use the trained model to predict categories for new user input.
